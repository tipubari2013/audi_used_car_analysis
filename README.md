Reading the csv file
- EDA using groupby/pivot_table and barplot (total 9 barplots), based on model, transmission, and fuelType
 - A. What are the top 5 selling car models in the dataset?
 - B. What's the average selling price of the top 5 selling car models?
 - C. What's the total sale of the top 5 selling car models?
  - Separating the numeric features and target variable, 
  - Split the original dataset into the train set (80%) and the test set (20%), 
  - Perform Linear Regression and Predict the 'Price' from the test set, 
  - Find the RMSE value from the actual test data and the predicted data.
 - Perform One-hot Encoding
 - Split the original dataset into the train set (80%) and the test set (20%),
 - Perform Linear Regression and Predict the 'Price' from the test set,
 - Show the coefficients of your linear regression model for each feature and show the y-intercept value of your linear regression model. (Interpret the coefficients)
 - (F) Find the MAE, MAPE, MSE, RMSE, coefficient of determination values from the actual target variable and the predicted target variable.
 - (G) Compare the actual and predicted target variable through visualization
